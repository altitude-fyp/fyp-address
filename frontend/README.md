## Citi Address Analytics Tool

CAAT is an internal application for Citibank to periodically collect address-related data from multiple public data sources, pre-process and analyse. We aim to generate insights that supplements Citibank's existing models and use cases, such as targeted financial offering recommendations to enhance the experience for both customers and businesses.
